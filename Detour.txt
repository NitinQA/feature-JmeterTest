Abhi:  You had asked me the question, if we turn-off the Detour for the FFL, then how do we inform the paid user that this function is there.  We don’t.  The minute they start paying, the DETOUR function automatically gets turned on.  How is this different to offering in the FFL – because, we still don’t tell people about DETOUR – it is (was) just there !
 

That said, we will provide a rule in the Mileage, which will be turned ON by default, and if someone does not want to use it, they can turn it off. 


3 months free, then paid. - Mileage google & Mileage GPS
Show the user that this is available for only 90 days.
detour will be paid function which will be only provided if user purchases Mielage(google) package
User cannot edit any rejected expense,
FM can export and approver can approve it..
